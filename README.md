# Shooter Template
Designed as a minimal starting point for your projects in s&box.

## Features
- First person pawn
- Simple pawn controller
- Simple weapon system

## Controls
- Regular movement with WASD
- Shoot weapon with LMB

## A Note
- Why is making a new project in s&box impossible without a PHD
- Why are the Player and PlayerController parent classes deprecated
- Why is the template repository hidden away on facepunches github and the default project given to new developers is the least useful thing on the planet. no player controller, just a noclipping watermelon. Who thought this was a good idea.
